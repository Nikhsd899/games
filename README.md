User Story

As a user I should be able to search for the specific game that I am looking for. 
As a user, the information on the desired game generates on the screen along with the image when I click on it.
Also, one would be able to add the item to their favorites list as well when they click on it. 
There would be a searchbar where you can click on it and it leads to a database of the games. 
There would be an API where we pull this information from.
